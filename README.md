#### 📊 **Data Analytics Questions** 📊

1. **Which BART station is the busiest?**  
   - Identify the station with the highest number of passengers.

2. **What is the least popular BART route?**  
   - Determine the route with the lowest ridership.

3. **When is the best time to go to SF from Berkeley if you want to find a seat?**  
   - Analyze the data to find the optimal time to commute comfortably.

4. **Which day of the week is the busiest?**  
   - Discover which day has the highest ridership.

5. **How many people take the BART late at night?**  
   - Calculate the number of late-night passengers.

#### 🔍 **Data Science Questions** 🔍

**Question A:**  
*Compute the straight-line distance between every station.*  
- Use geographical data to calculate the distances.

**Question B:**  
*Build a model that can predict the number of people commuting to work by BART between any 2 stations.*  
- **Approach:** 
  - Use regression techniques or machine learning models to predict ridership.
- **Additional Data Needed:**
  - Historical ridership data, weather conditions, special events, etc.
- **Usage by Officials:**
  - Optimize schedules, improve resource allocation, and enhance customer experience.

#### 🛠️ **Data Preparation** 🛠️

1. **Append the Two Ridership Files for 2016 and 2017**  
   - Combine the data from both years for a comprehensive analysis.

2. **Merge the Station Data File**  
   - Integrate station information with the ridership data.

3. **Answer Data Analytics Questions**  
   - Utilize the prepared data to answer the analytics questions listed above.
